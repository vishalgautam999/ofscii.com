                                Ankita Singh, a Class 12 student from Jharkhand's Dumka, was aiming to become a police officer. 
                                Her hopes were dashed on an ill-fated night when she was set ablaze by her alleged stalker, identified as Shahrukh, on August 23.
                                She succumbed to her burn injuries in the early hours of Sunday, August 28.

                            <b> WHO WAS ANKITA SINGH?</b><br>
                             Nineteen-year-old Ankita was a student at a girls' school and she aspired to become a police officer. 
                               Having lost her mother to cancer in her childhood, Ankita's family faced a financial crunch as they were compelled to sell their land and property to avail of her mother's treatment. Sources confirmed that her father's income was Rs 200 per day and, owing to the situation, 
                               Ankita gave tuition to students and managed to earn Rs 1,000 every month.
                               Ankita's father, her younger sibling, who is a Class 6 student, and Ankita lived in a two-room house in Dumka.
                               Ankita was burnt alive on August 23 after the accused allegedly poured petrol on her while she was asleep in her bedroom. Shahrukh allegedly poured the inflammable fuel on her from the window of her room. 
                               She was taken to the hospital shortly after the incident and on August 28, she succumbed to her burn injuries.

                               <b>Statement of Victim Ankita Singh</b><br>
                               In her statement to the police after the horrifying incident, she said that the accused had threatened to kill her if she did not speak to him. Shahrukh has been taken into Jharkhand Police custody and reportedly, an image of the accused was heavily criticised. 
                               In the image, a handcuffed accused is seen grinning after he was nabbed by police.
Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren announced an ex gratia amount of Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of Ankita on August 29. 
Subsequent to the announcement, Ankita's father said that his daughter could have been saved had the chief minister given the amount while she was alive. According to him, the amount could have been put to use for better treatment of Ankita.

<b>
    Last Words Of Ankita
</b><br>
Ankita said that the accused had called her on her mobile around 10 days ago, pestering her to become his friend.
"He called me again around 8 pm on Monday (August 22) and told me that he would kill me if I did not talk to him. I informed my father about the threat, after which he assured me that he would talk to the man’s family on Tuesday," said Ankita.
"After having our dinner, we went to sleep. I was sleeping in another room. On Tuesday morning, I experienced a sensation of pain in my back and could smell something burning. I found him running away when I opened my eyes. I started screaming in pain and went to my father’s room.
My parents doused the fire and took me to the hospital,” she informed the police hours before her death.

<b>if Ankita gets justice then we can reduce the crime and its criteria. and also we can warn all other criminals that do not try again to do crime.</b> <br>

                            <b>A story of a simple girl who gets justice by Indian Government</b>
                            <p> This story is about a girl named <b>Shreya Jaiswal,</b> who was a resident of city Gorakhpur or took admission in B.Tech college in Kanpur to complete her studies.She had come after completing her inter or lived in hostel. Then there she became known quite well. She was very naive, she was a student of computer science. She was very much divided from the wards of her own hostel, who was also the head of the department of that college, then everything was going well. After some time, some girl became his roommate, then people became very good friends with you.
It used to get attached very quickly, most of all, even with analog, after that she used to share all her talk with those people or whenever she needed any help, then take us from the house of her warden sir. Then all went well till some time. After that the roommate she had started feeling jealous about how she was so divided. Then all of them started fighting with him, the daily fight started getting estranged. After that, the band became a band for some time.
Then there was a holiday in the middle, then the warden of the hostel changed and then he gave the charge of hostel to Shreya. Then Shreya was very happy or she used to manage her hostel very well along with her studies or her juniors with teachers, her batchmates, everyone respected her a lot, believed that all this thing gives her some room in the net fees. Talked to everyone and asked to decide.
Two, when she went there to do SBSE discussion, her roommates beat her a lot, which was 4 girls, beat her with soaked shoes and then abused her a lot, then Shreya informed her warden Mum, after that go Shreya Bahu Ji Big Wa Tab Gay Tab Or the ambulance was called in heavily soaked shoes or we were accepted in the midnight ICO.
After some time he was forcibly discharged, due to which he could not be treated by Shi. Then Shreya did it in her house, after which her mother or brother reached the Next Day Hostel. Then asked the help of the unhonored principal or told the whole thing to the principal, after which the warden got a tooth or got a warning that if something like this happens again, then the warden will be removed but those girls did not get any punishment or Shreya Mia left after giving her assurance. 
Then everything was normal for a few days, then Shreya had repeatedly threatened to fuck the hostel, her warden also started getting annoyed with her or used to call her to her house for wrong things or her warden 4 side gay girl support.When Shreya did not leave the hostel even after receiving many threats, the girls came in support of the wards and made a video of her taking a bath. For which the warden or those people blackmail her a lot, Shreya started living in depression, neither eating anything nor talking to anyone, she was locked in the room alone. Then when she could not say anything to anyone, she attempted suicide, after which she was admitted to the hospital. Or by flipping his note, his warden made a fake lamp.
FIR, police complaint, media came, everything happened but the whole matter was suppressed by paying money. After which Shreya did not get justice till today or closed the case by eating
So I have only one purpose of writing this story that whatever wrong is happening to any girl or boy, then do not sit silent like this or try suicide because even in today's time justice is not found, only if there is a family. Whether you fought your own battles or even in today's time, there are many such cases which did not get justice or criminals keep roaming like this, then this should not happen to anyone or anything.Tomorrow it can happen in your house too, so today you are eating anger, tomorrow someone will eat or not get justice 4 or the courage is divided that whatever they do, they do not get any punishment.
So doing such a number a lot will do nothing by making any rules and regulations unless you keep your inner soul clean. Or such n crime will continue to increase. Give justice to people or help them.

Thank You
