                        <h3>About Murder Crime</h3>
                        <p>Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, 
                            especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought.
                            This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, 
                            such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is killing committed in the absence of malice,brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized,
                            is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.</p>
                        <h3>Murder(Indian Low)</h3>
                        <p>In India according to Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, murder is defined as follows:<br>

Murder.--Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or- 167 2ndly.-If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused. or- 3rdly.-If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or- 4thly.-If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without 
any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.[1]</p>
                        <h3>Degree Of Murder</h3>
                        <p>"Murder in the second degree" redirects here. For the album, see Murder in the Second Degree.
"Premeditated murder" redirects here. For the film, see Premeditated Murder.
Some jurisdictions divide murder by degrees. The distinction between 
first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in Canadian murder law and U.S. murder law.
The most common division is between first- and second-degree murder. Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form. The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation. In some, murders committed by acts such as strangulation,
poisoning, or lying in wait are also treated as first-degree murder.</p>
                        <h3>Common Low</h3>
                        <p>According to Blackstone, English common law identified murder as a public wrong.
                            According to common law, murder is considered to be malum in se, that is, an act which is evil within itself. An act such as murder is wrong or evil by its very nature,[citation needed] and it is the very nature of the
                            act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime.[29]</p>
                        <h3>Exclusions</h3>
                        <h5>General</h5>
                     <p>Suicide does not constitute murder in most societies. Assisting a suicide, however, may be considered murder in some circumstances.</p>
                     <h3>History of murder rates</h3>
                     <p>According to scholar Pieter Spierenburg homicide rates per 100,000 in Europe have fallen over the centuries, from 35 per 100,000 in medieval times, to 20 in 1500 AD, 5 in 1700, to below two per 100,000 in 1900.[138]</p>
                     <h3>
                         Some Ways To Stop Murder
                     </h3>
                     <h5>1) Implement strict policies on alcohol</h5>
                     <p>There is a link between alcohol and violence. A study done in 2010 found that alcohol stores are strongly linked to gun assaults. Being in possession of a gun while drunk is, therefore, not allowed.

Policies can be implemented to limit issues related to alcohol in America and other countries across the world. Some of these policies include:

<br>* High taxes on alcohol<br>
 * Minimizing the number of alcohol outlets<br>
* Denying alcohol users who commit offenses after drinking the right to drink.</p>
                     <h5>2) Deploy focused deterrence policing</h5>
                     <p>Proper understanding of community policing and executing it is essential to curbing murders and other crimes. The right community policy is based on the “focused deterrence policing” strategy, which is impactful.
It focuses on a community’s specific problems such as gun violence and rampant murders. It then follows the trail of the individuals and groups involved in such acts and focuses on them.
The community is strongly responsible for conveying strict and transparent standards against violence.</p>
                     <h5>3) Fight identity theft</h5>
                     <p>Identity theft is another factor that can, in one way or the other, lead to other crimes and, even worse, murder.
                         It ranges from financial, criminal, medical, synthetic, driver’s license, and insurance identity thefts.</p>
                     <h5>4) Eliminate illegal drugs to reduce impact</h5>
                     <p> Drugs have a high impact on murders and other crimes. Excessive use of drugs has driven users to cause violence, crimes, and insecurity around the globe.

All anti-violence initiatives should also focus on fighting hard drugs and the results of long-term use.</p>
