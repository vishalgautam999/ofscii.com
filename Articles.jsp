                                <p><b>Sections 299 and 300</b><br> of the Indian Penal Code (1860) deals with culpable homicide and murder, respectively. 
                                        Generally, the thin line of distinction between them is the reason why many find it interesting. 
                                        Even it poses difficulty for advocates and legal practitioners who are unsure where to lay the case. 
                                        Murder and culpable homicide appear to be more similar than they are, but they are not interchangeable terms. 
                                        Section 299 of the Indian Penal Code defines culpable homicide, whereas Section 300 deals with the concept of murder.
                                        The person who begins to learn these notions is always snarled up by these phrases. The term ‘homicide’ refers to the
                                        killing of a human being, the term ‘culpable homicide’ refers to the unlawful killing of a 
                                        person and the term ‘murder’ also refers to the killing of a person. So what are the slight points to be pondered to arrive at a conclusion? This article deals with every such aspect of the topic. .</p>
